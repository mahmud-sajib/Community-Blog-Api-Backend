To run a Spring Boot application from GitHub on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Git: If you haven't already, install Git on your machine. You can download it from the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. You can find the repository's URL on the GitHub repository page.

3. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Spring Boot requires Java to run. You can download the JDK from the Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or choose an alternative JDK distribution like OpenJDK.

4. Build the project: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project's directory using the terminal or command prompt. Typically, you should see a `pom.xml` file in the project's root directory. Run the following command to build the project using Maven (assuming you have Maven installed):

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command will compile the source code, run tests, and generate a runnable JAR or WAR file.

5. Run the application: After a successful build, you can run the Spring Boot application using the following command:

   ```shell
   java -jar target/<your-project-name>.jar
   ```

   Replace `<your-project-name>` with the actual name of the JAR or WAR file generated during the build process.

6. Access the application: Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (assuming the application is configured to run on the default port 8080). However, if the application uses a different port, you need to modify the URL accordingly.

That's it! You have successfully cloned and run a Spring Boot application from GitHub on your local machine. Make sure to check the project's documentation or README file for any additional configuration or setup instructions specific to the application you're running.
